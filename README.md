This is a `kubewarden` demo for the `summer-is-open` event.

This project uses the [demo project](https://github.com/saschagrunert/demo) to run the examples.

The second part of the demo relies on some bits that are specific to
my setup, like `registry.ereslibre.net`, that is used to deploy the a
policy in the Kubernetes cluster during the demo.
